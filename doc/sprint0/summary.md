# Summary - CaRnS 
*[Car Rent 'n' Sell]*

## **Project Objective**  

CaRnS is a web peer-to-peer vehicle sharing application and marketplace. Our objective is to offer a platform to vehicle owners to buy, rent, sell or share *any* vehicles (predominantly cars, hence the name). The web application displays listings of the desired vehicle type the user wants to rent/buy in the city of their choice. In addition, it provides a means to contact and schedule vehicle pick-ups with vendors at a desired cost and location. Users will also be able to create listings for any vehicle they wish to sell or rent out. 


## **Key Users**  
- Buyer &rarr; A user who uses the application to buy one or more vehicles.

- Seller &rarr; A user who creates listings and sells their vehicle(s). 

- Renter &rarr; A user who rents out a vehicle from another user on the platform.

- Sharer &rarr; A user who creates listings to allow others to rent out their vehicle.


## **Usage Scenarios/Personas**
Mike Zack, a 29 year old investor, needs a means of visiting startups before chosing to invest into them after his car stopping functioning properly. While he find public transportation inconvenient, he realizes that taxis and car rentals are expensive. He wants a platform to buy a second-hand car at a decent price in good condition and communicate with car owners before making his purchase decision.

Tinna Ashly, a 27 year old software developer, works from home and owns two carsd. She is considering selling one of her two cars and renting out the other as they are rarely used. She needs a platform to communicate with buyers and renters to ensure her vehicles are in the right hands.    


## **Key Principles**
Quality: We strive to give users a responsive, efficient and well-constructed platform, as well as ensure that users find the vehicles they request in good condition. 

Ease-of-use & convenience: A central aspect of any marketplace is that it should be effortless to exchange goods and seemless for both buyers and sellers to integrate into their daily schedules.

Flexibility: Whether a user wants to rent a mini-van for a family weekend road trip, spontaneously buy a bike to help them get back into shape or rent out their Tesla for a month, CaRnS gives users the opportunity to schedule pick-ups for any vechicle they access or market.
